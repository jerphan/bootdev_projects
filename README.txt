This repository is just to keep my bootdev projects, and to practice using GitHub. Current projects include:
Bookbot- A text file analyzer
Asteroids- A game based on a ship moving around to avoid collision with asteroid objects
Ai_Agent- A tool that is able to read and write files using the Gemini 2.5 flash model to debug code

More documentation can be found in each project's README files
